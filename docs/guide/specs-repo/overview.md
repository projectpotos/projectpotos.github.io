The idea behind the Specs Repository is to have one git repository defining how your client should look, what role should be applied and when each role should be applied.
This would allow for generic roles which are not customized for a specific Linux client.

The specs repositoy is define upon image creation and allows to exend a clients functionallity after it has been deployed.
